### Creating an App

To run the app, run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.


### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
